# ADR 0001: Sprite Atlas Workflow Recipe

## Status

Accepted.

## Decision

Add a new `sprite-atlas` Recipe Module and route-lazy workbench UI. Keep the existing `spritesheet` recipe as the lightweight one-shot grid generator.

The `sprite-atlas` workflow is a local-first run folder workflow:

- a Sprite Atlas Run stores request, prompts, layout guides, handoff jobs, raw rows, extracted frames, curation data, atlas outputs, a manifest, and QA reports
- the recipe uses provider-independent task kind `sprite_sheet`
- row art is produced by existing Codex or image generation jobs, one row or state at a time
- deterministic workflow actions prepare, import, extract, compose, and QA run folder artifacts
- final atlas artifacts are catalog-compatible, with `manifest.json.frame_layout` as runtime source of truth

The UI must expose the workflow as a recoverable production workbench:

- preset discovery is browsable and filterable
- run history is visible inside the recipe
- row progress is visible at a glance
- prompts and layout guides are inspectable per row
- batch handoff creation is supported without duplicating already handled rows
- blocked rows remain explicit sidecars instead of fake art

Studio’s built-in workflow uses its own backend services. The standalone sprite pipeline is an external authoring tool and is not required by the app.

The backend owns row progress. When the job queue accepts a row job, the backend records the job set on the row and marks the row as generating. When a job settles, the backend reconciles the row:

- The first finished image of the set is imported and normalized per ADR 0010. Later images stay in the Catalog for a manual import.
- A job that is not in the row's current set is ignored.
- A failed, cancelled, or needs-review job blocks the row only when no other job of the set is still pending or has an image. A blocked row still accepts a later image of the set.
- Startup recovery and the Sync action read the stored jobs again and apply the same rules.

The browser does not coordinate rows. It shows the run, refetches it when the backend reports a change, and keeps a manual import for an image that the user chooses.

New run state, handoff inputs, and extracted working frames live in `.studio/state/sprite-atlas/<runId>`. The atlas PNG and manifest use the output directory and layout captured when the run starts. Older runs remain readable at their stored paths. The shared background choice resolves the run contract: native transparency disables chroma instructions and keeps alpha through atlas composition.

## Consequences

Positive:

- Sprite Atlas becomes a real production workflow instead of a prompt-only recipe.
- The UI can explain blocked stages and partial progress.
- Existing provider separation remains intact. No provider-specific task names are introduced.
- The workflow can support sprites, tilesets, textures, asset packs, and custom atlas contracts.

Tradeoffs:

- This adds backend workflow state beyond the normal single-job image path.
- Full visual validation still depends on real row art from image generation.
- Local extraction and composition requires deterministic image tooling. The first implementation must expose dependency readiness clearly.

## Non-goals

- Do not replace Character Lab.
- Do not turn Cozy Studio into a generic provider router.
- Do not generate fake placeholder art when image generation is blocked.
- Do not store generated run folders in the repository.
- Do not make curation a fully featured external editor in the first pass.
