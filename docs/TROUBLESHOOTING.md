# Troubleshooting

## Settings refresh and imports

Settings keeps unsaved edits when you refresh diagnostics. Save is available after you change a field and enter a nonempty output filename template. A failed provider diagnostic can appear beside successfully loaded or saved settings; it does not mean the settings write failed.

In External Output Sources, scan a registered source before choosing files. Select all applies to the files returned by that scan. Files that fail to import remain selected so you can retry; files that import successfully leave the list. The file list scrolls and includes every result returned by the scan.

## Fast diagnostics

1. Run `bun run studio:onboard --probe` or use the in-app onboarding checklist.
2. Run `bun run studio:init` when Bootstrap Configuration or the Studio Library still needs repair.
3. Reuse the running Studio instance. If no instance is running, start both UI and backend with `bun run dev`.
4. Run `bun run providers:preflight` for the selected provider. Use `bun run runtime:doctor` only for the Codex route.
5. Open `http://localhost:17223/api/health` (or your configured API port).
6. If a quality gate failed, run `bun run tooling:logs` and inspect `*.latest.log`.

## First-run onboarding

The welcome surface shows the selected connection, images folder and setup status. Sign in with ChatGPT from the welcome screen or Settings → Accounts & models. Setup details expand when work is needed and collapse when Studio is ready. Codex CLI, its login and app-server matter only when you choose the Codex route. A setup request authorizes ordinary initialization; reuse a healthy instance and preserve existing paths and data.

Headless equivalent:

```bash
bun run studio:onboard --probe
bun run studio:onboard --setup
```

Mutating steps need an explicit yes. On a TTY the command asks `[y/N]`. Agents that already have user authority can pass `--yes`. A no leaves disk unchanged.

Default Studio Library is `Library` inside the private Cozy Studio app-data folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Cozy Studio` on Windows). Generated images go to Pictures/Cozy Studio. To keep or choose another library folder, set an absolute path in `.env.local`:

```env
STUDIO_LIBRARY_DIR=D:\Cozy Studio Library
```

Then run `bun run studio:init`. Existing `STUDIO_LIBRARY_DIR` is kept. The app does not auto-migrate an older library.

External folder to scan is an import source, not the generation destination. Generate writes to the images folder chosen in onboarding or Settings → Files & naming, which is Pictures/Cozy Studio on a new library.

## Common startup problems

### `codex` is missing or does not respond

Symptoms: `codexCli.available: false`. Jobs using the Codex provider do not start. This does not block an authenticated ChatGPT HTTP connection.

Make sure that the selected CLI path and `PATH` are correct. Restart the terminal after you install Codex. Then run `bun run runtime:doctor`.

CLI metadata helps diagnosis. Missing app-server support or CLI authentication blocks the Codex route only. Do not block setup for a hardcoded tool release.

```bash
bun run runtime:doctor
```

The doctor reports the selected executable, CLI metadata, app-server support, and the recommended action. It does not print secrets.

### Cozy Studio stopped working after a Codex update

Symptoms: a checkout that worked before the update no longer starts jobs. `app-server` fails to bind. Runtime Doctor reports a path inside `node_modules/.../vendor`.

1. Stop the old `bun run dev` process and start it again. Managed shutdown closes the UI, the backend, and the owned `codex app-server` process tree.
2. Run `bun run runtime:doctor`. Make sure that it selects a supported desktop, npm, Bun, or PATH launcher with `app-server` capability.
3. Open `http://localhost:17223/api/health`. `checks.onboardingReady` is true after the Library is ready and either Studio ChatGPT Sign in or Codex CLI + app-server + Local Codex Session is ready.
4. If a custom `STUDIO_CODEX_CLI_PATH` or `CODEX_CLI_PATH` is set, point it at a stable launcher. Never pin a release-specific vendor path.

The normal readiness path probes the selected launcher first. It scans fallback candidates only when that launcher fails. A changed version string alone is not a setup failure.

### An old `codex` install is selected

Symptoms: jobs fail with WebSocket connection errors. `runtime:doctor` reports `codex_cli_legacy`. The selected CLI lacks `codex app-server`. Health shows `codexRuntime.status: blocked`.

Remove or update old npm shims under the user npm directory. Make sure that the OpenAI Codex desktop CLI binary is selected. Then restart `bun run dev:server`.

A common Windows case: `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\npm\codex.cmd` points to an unrelated legacy npm package named `codex`. OpenAI Codex is missing or lower in `PATH`. The setup UI shows the selected executable, the failing command, top candidates, and copyable repair commands.

Repair:

```bash
npm uninstall -g codex
codex login
bun run runtime:doctor
```

If Codex is still missing after you remove the old shim, install or update the current OpenAI Codex CLI through the supported channel. Then run `bun run runtime:doctor` again.

### `codex app-server` is not available

Symptoms: the backend starts but generations do not progress. `appServer.running: false`.

Make sure that app-server support is present, the Codex session is signed in, and the WebSocket port is free.

### Codex session expired

Symptoms: Codex CLI exists but jobs fail with permission or authorization errors.

For the Codex provider, run `codex login` and complete its ChatGPT authentication flow, then restart the existing Studio runtime if needed. Studio’s separate ChatGPT provider signs in through Settings → Accounts & models; that does not repair a Codex CLI session.

Studio ChatGPT Sign in uses the Codex device-code flow. OpenAI does not document this as a supported Studio API. The provider selector separates ChatGPT HTTP from Codex app-server and captures the provider contract when the job is accepted. ChatGPT uses the existing credential store, so splitting providers does not require another login. If the selected route is unavailable, Studio blocks the job with the route-specific setup action instead of silently switching accounts.

Luna Reserve belongs to the signed-in Codex app-server session. When the regular Codex bucket is exhausted, select `GPT-Reserve` and the desired reasoning mode, such as `MAX`. Recommended image jobs use Studio Settings Sign in and the ChatGPT provider instead. That HTTP path does not create Codex turns, so it does not spend the Codex app-server usage bucket. It can still hit the ChatGPT HTTP usage limit. This separation does not establish an independent subscription quota, and does not provide public OpenAI API credits. An API-key route requires separate OpenAI API credentials and billing.

### ChatGPT HTTP generation is rejected

A connected session only confirms authentication. Structured provider error codes distinguish exhausted quota, temporary rate limits, expired sessions, missing access, and service failures. A generic HTTP 429 or “rate limit” message is a temporary limit, not proof that the subscription is exhausted. Job diagnostics retain a sanitized provider message and `Retry-After` when supplied.

New ChatGPT jobs capture HTTP settings under `providerOptions.chatgpt`; new Codex jobs capture app-server settings under `providerOptions.codex`. Existing jobs keep their captured contracts, including historical Codex HTTP jobs. No provider switch occurs after failure. Interrupted or ambiguous submissions require review rather than automatic resubmission.

### Grok Imagine is missing or blocked

Symptoms: the Grok Settings card shows `not_configured`, or Grok Jobs fail before execution.

```bash
grok version
grok models
bun run providers:preflight -- --provider=grok
```

The preflight must report `canAttempt=true`. Sign in with xAI from Studio Settings, set `XAI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`, or run `grok login` and complete browser authentication.

Some SuperGrok tiers return HTTP 403 after a successful xAI Sign in. That is an entitlement gate, not a bad token. Studio uses the signed-in Grok Build CLI only when the explicit HTTP fallback policy allows it. An uncertain submission must not be sent again through another transport.

If Studio selects the wrong binary, set `STUDIO_GROK_CLI_PATH` to the stable native Grok executable and restart the backend.

`grok models` on Grok Build 1.0.4 prints `Default model:` plus a `*` default and `-` other models. HTTP generation uses `grok-imagine-image-2.0` unless `GROK_IMAGE_MODEL` or Settings store a current `grok-imagine-*` id. If a stored Settings model is missing from the list, intake rejects the job before enqueue.

Grok Jobs reject these cases before enqueue:

- unresolved remote references
- source files outside the Job captured Studio Library
- more than five CLI source images or three HTTP edit source images
- unsupported explicit aspect ratios
- output counts other than one

Import the reference into the Library, or choose a supported ratio (`1:1`, `16:9`, `9:16`, `4:3`, or `3:4`) and retry.
The Generate dock names the same blocks.

Default supports Grok, including its optional styles. Other workflows must declare Grok support in their Recipe Module and have a compiler fixture.
Grok treats a styles recipe run with managed references as image editing.
A run without references is direct image generation.
Studio creates one Persistent Job per requested batch image.
Each Grok session still produces exactly one image.

### Google Nano Banana is missing or blocked

Symptoms: the Google Settings card shows `not_configured`, Sign in cannot start, or a Google Job is rejected before execution.

```bash
bun run providers:preflight -- --provider=google
```

Use one of these credential paths:

- Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` to a restricted Gemini API key.
- Set `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`, then connect Google from Studio Settings. Add `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` only when your Desktop app client requires it.

The Google Cloud project must have the Generative Language API enabled. OAuth users also need permission to consume services in the billing project. The preflight reports the missing field without returning its value.

Studio supports `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-image`, `gemini-3.1-flash-image`, and `gemini-3-pro-image`. Flash Lite produces 1K images only. Remove an old `gemini-2.5-flash-image` override before retrying.

The OAuth callback binds to `127.0.0.1` on a temporary port. If the browser cannot return to Studio, allow local loopback traffic, cancel the pending login, and retry. A state mismatch closes that login. Studio does not reuse credentials from Antigravity, Gemini CLI, a browser profile, or another token store.

### Antigravity is missing or blocked

Symptoms: the Antigravity Settings card shows `not_configured`, or the Job fails before the CLI starts.

```bash
agy --version
agy models
bun run providers:preflight -- --provider=antigravity
```

Studio requires a current CLI with the headless stream, sandbox, model, and permission controls. Open `agy` interactively and complete Google authentication when `agy models` reports an authentication error. Set `STUDIO_ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_PATH` to an absolute native executable path only when normal discovery selects the wrong binary.

Antigravity Jobs allow one `generate_image` call and one output image. Managed edit sources must already be inside the Job's captured Studio Library. Studio stages copies in its temporary workspace, does not pass other provider keys to the CLI, and does not delete Antigravity's artifact history.

A ready preflight proves CLI, login, flags, and model discovery. It does not prove image credits or account entitlement. A live generation remains the final external-account check.

### Only the UI is running

Symptoms: `dev:ui` opens but jobs and assets do not sync.

Use `bun run dev`, or run `dev:server` and `dev:ui` in parallel.

### Ports are busy

Symptoms: Vite or Bun reports `listen` errors.

Change `STUDIO_SERVER_PORT` or `STUDIO_CODEX_WS_PORT` in `.env.local`.
`bun run dev` returns the first failing child exit code.
On Windows it terminates wrapper process trees so Vite or Codex children do not keep the ports after a failed start.

### `studio:init` reports a foreign-key failure

Symptoms: SQLite reports `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` while a migration rebuilds `jobs` or another parent table.

Current migrations preserve child rows and validate `foreign_key_check` before they commit. Stop the local server. Update the checkout and dependencies. Then run:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run studio:init
```

Do not delete `.studio/studio.sqlite` to bypass the error. If it still fails, keep the database plus its `-wal` and `-shm` files together. Report the exact stack. Restore from a copy only after the server is stopped.

## When terminal output is too short

If `check`, `lint`, `test`, or `build` fails and the terminal output is truncated:

1. Run `bun run tooling:logs`.
2. Inspect the matching `*.latest.log`.
3. Include the failed command and relevant sanitized excerpt in issue or pull request notes. Remove credentials, private prompts and personal paths.

The full test task caps Vitest at eight workers to avoid Windows filesystem and process contention. Set `VITEST_MAX_WORKERS` to a positive integer only when you need a different local limit.

## Studio Library problems

If the default Cozy Studio library folder is wrong for this machine, set an absolute `STUDIO_LIBRARY_DIR` in `.env.local`. Then run:

```bash
bun run studio:init
```

## Storage and heavy logs

Run `bun run storage:audit` to review SQLite size, WAL/SHM files, logs, transcripts, references, historical inline payloads, missing thumbnails, duplicate references, and compactable payloads.
The command does not print private content.

From the app, open Settings → Advanced & maintenance. You can run audit, compaction plans, thumbnail backfill plans, and tooling-log pruning through `/api/maintenance`.

`storage:compact` is dry-run by default. To write historical compaction, stop the local server and run:

```bash
bun run storage:compact -- --write --confirm=compact-inline-payloads
```

Backend logs rotate under `.studio/logs/history`. `/api/logs` and the activity panel show a recent window, not an infinite historical file.

Tooling logs keep one `.latest.log` per task and prune timestamped runs automatically. To clean them by hand:

```bash
bun run tooling:logs:prune
```

To warm missing historical thumbnails without writing first:

```bash
bun run storage:thumbnails:backfill
```

To write a planned thumbnail batch:

```bash
bun run storage:thumbnails:backfill -- --limit=1000 --write --confirm=backfill-thumbnails
```

## Useful commands

```bash
bun run studio:onboard
bun run studio:init
bun run dev:server
bun run dev:ui
bun run runtime:doctor
bun run providers:preflight
bun run validate:fast
bun run storage:audit
bun run storage:thumbnails:backfill
bun run check
bun run test
bun run build
```
