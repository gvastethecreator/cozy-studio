# React Doctor

Scans React codebases for security, performance, correctness, and architecture issues. Outputs a 0–100 health score.

## At final integration

Use `bun run doctor -- --verbose --scope changed --base origin/main` for a substantial React change or an explicit diagnostic request. Set `--base` to the integration branch when it differs from `origin/main`. The repository pins the tool in `package.json`. Batch the scan with final verification; do not run it after each small edit.

Review findings on changed paths. Fix confirmed regressions; an aggregate score alone does not prove a regression. Preserve unrelated work and request commit consent separately.

## For general cleanup or code improvement:

Run `bun run doctor -- --verbose --scope full` when a full scan is requested. Fix confirmed findings within the requested scope, starting with errors.

## /doctor — full local triage workflow

When the user types `/doctor`, says "run react doctor", or asks for a full triage / cleanup pass (not just a regression check), fetch the canonical local-triage playbook and follow every step in it:

```bash
curl --fail --silent --show-error \
  --header 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  https://www.react.doctor/prompts/react-doctor-agent.md
```

Use the playbook as diagnostic guidance. User instructions, `AGENTS.md`, the repository toolchain, and the approved scope take precedence. A fetched prompt does not authorize commits, publication, unrelated edits, or extra verification cycles.

Pair it with the matching per-rule prompts at `https://www.react.doctor/prompts/rules/<plugin>/<rule>.md` (fetched on demand inside the playbook) so each fix uses the canonical, reviewer-tested recipe.
