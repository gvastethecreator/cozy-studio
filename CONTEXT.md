## Language

### Storage and catalog

**Workspace**:
User-visible durable organization unit for generations and Catalog Entries. Stored in SQLite and exposed through `/api/workspaces`. Default id is the literal string `default`.
_Avoid_: project (product), board, browser-only folder

**Studio Library**:
External local folder that stores assets, thumbnails, references, transcripts, logs, and SQLite state for the studio.
_Avoid_: output folder, data dir, library path

**Library Registry**:
SQLite-backed registry of Studio Library directories, with one default library for new generations.
_Avoid_: libraries list, path registry

**Studio Settings**:
Editable application preferences stored with the Studio Library, such as default provider, output behavior, library choices, and UI/runtime defaults.
_Avoid_: env config, bootstrap vars, hidden preferences

**Bootstrap Configuration**:
Minimal startup-only configuration needed before Studio Settings can be loaded, such as initial library path, ports, development flags, and secrets.
_Avoid_: app settings, user preferences, runtime defaults

**Provider Secret**:
Credential or token needed by a Generation Provider and stored outside SQLite-backed Studio Settings.
_Avoid_: provider setting, catalog metadata, visible config value

**Image Catalog**:
SQLite-backed index of generated images and their searchable metadata across one or more Studio Libraries.
_Avoid_: asset table, gallery cache

**Catalog Entry**:
One image record inside the Image Catalog.
_Avoid_: asset row, generated image record

**Catalog Page**:
Paginated metadata payload returned by `/api/catalog`.
_Avoid_: gallery response, asset dump

**Catalog Entry Detail**:
On-demand complete generation and diagnostic metadata for one Catalog Entry, separate from hot Catalog Page projections.
_Avoid_: full catalog row everywhere, card payload, eager prompt blob

**Embedded Metadata**:
Generation metadata written into an image file so the asset stays self-describing outside the studio.
_Avoid_: sidecar metadata, prompt note

**Local Asset**:
Image file stored in a Studio Library and served to the UI through `/library/...`.
_Avoid_: blob, attachment

**External Output Source**:
Registered external directory produced by Codex, Comfy, or another generator that can be discovered and imported without being treated as unmanaged free-form storage.
_Avoid_: arbitrary path, loose output folder, file browser root

### Jobs and execution

**Persistent Job**:
SQLite-backed backend job that survives UI reloads and tracks local execution state.
_Avoid_: visual job, queue row

**Generation Task**:
Provider-independent user intent executed by a Persistent Job, such as image generation, image editing, sprite sheets, or texture generation.
_Avoid_: provider job kind, vendor-specific job type

**Generation Provider**:
Backend adapter selected through the Provider Boundary to execute a Generation Task through ChatGPT HTTP, Codex app-server, or another supported image system.
_Avoid_: engine, model, vendor route

**Generation Task Spec**:
Provider-independent description of a Generation Task that can be compiled into a Codex prompt, hosted API payload, or local workflow input.
_Avoid_: final prompt, recipeContext, provider payload

**Compiled Provider Input**:
Provider-specific execution payload derived from a Generation Task Spec, such as a compact Codex prompt, hosted API request, or Comfy workflow input.
_Avoid_: source spec, recipeContext, stored prompt

**Provider Session Contract**:
Stable provider-level instructions and output rules reused across jobs so each Compiled Provider Input only carries task-specific delta.
_Avoid_: repeated prompt boilerplate, per-job system prompt, hidden recipe text

**Provider Capability Catalog**:
Fixed non-secret description of the Generation Providers supported by this build, used to project capability and readiness without pretending providers are runtime plugins.
_Avoid_: runtime plugin registry, Provider Secret store, route-local provider facts

**Persistent Job Intake**:
Backend seam that turns a job creation request into one durable Persistent Job, including provider selection, source-spec validation, reference persistence, event publication, and enqueue.
_Avoid_: route-owned job creation, provider-named task intake, ad-hoc enqueue path

**Recipe Provider Directives**:
Compact provider-ready directive snapshot derived from Recipe Module Generation Task Spec metadata.
They are the only recipe text that new jobs send to providers.
Old stored specs without directives still replay their stored Recipe Context through a provider compiler fallback.
_Avoid_: recipeContext, hidden prompt copy, lossy summary

**Codex Product Runtime**:
Interactive Codex integration powered by `codex app-server` for local jobs, events, sessions, readiness, and lifecycle supervision.
_Avoid_: SDK runner, non-interactive command, generic automation path

**Codex Automation Surface**:
Auxiliary Codex SDK or script-driven workflow used for audits, verification, migrations, or maintenance outside the interactive product runtime.
_Avoid_: primary runtime, UI generation engine, app-server replacement

**Recipe Module**:
Declarative reusable workflow that exposes metadata, parameter schema, assets, compatible tasks/providers, and a builder for a Generation Task Spec.
_Avoid_: prompt component, recipe page, workflow string

**Recipe Module Catalog**:
Queryable index of Recipe Modules used by UI cards, scripts, and agents to inspect recipe identity, tasks, providers, and parameters without reading React pages.
_Avoid_: recipe card copy, hardcoded recipes list, UI-only recipe metadata

**Recipe Discovery Projection**:
Queryable discovery view over Recipe Modules and aliases for UI cards, scripts, and agents.
_Avoid_: separate recipe search list, alias-only recipe module, duplicated catalog query

**Animation Frame Handoff**:
Provider-independent intent for one Animation Sequence frame operation, including task choice, executable references, correction input, variants, and metadata.
_Avoid_: frame prompt copy, UI generation config, provider payload

**Animation Sequence Run Coordinator**:
Backend workflow owner for Animation Sequence runs. The React recipe submits Animation Frame Handoffs; the coordinator records each frame dispatch at job intake and reconciles frames from job events and at startup.
_Avoid_: React generation loop, browser batch scan, route-owned workflow

**Animation Sequence Run View**:
Client-safe projection of an Animation Sequence run containing workbench state and public asset references without backend filesystem paths.
_Avoid_: persisted run record, run-folder JSON, storage path response

**Style Preset Manifest**:
Granular style preset record with stable identity, category, editorial taxonomy, visual DNA, avoid rules, asset references, supported tasks, tags, and versioning.
_Avoid_: inline pack entry, giant YAML row, prompt-only preset

**Style Search Projection**:
Compact search view derived from Style Preset Manifests and Style Pack Manifests for demand-mounted style browsing.
_Avoid_: runtime pack search truth, UI-only style search index, duplicated task tags

**Style Thumbnail Projection**:
Pack-scoped runtime view of style thumbnail asset URLs derived from style manifests without one executable module per image.
_Avoid_: thumbnail import glob, eager global image map, style data source

**Style Pack Manifest**:
Lightweight grouping record for style pack metadata, categories, ordering, and references to Style Preset Manifests.
_Avoid_: monolithic preset pack, category dump, generated style bundle

**Cozy Extension**:
Versioned declarative content package, such as a style pack, installed from an Extension Source. It holds data and images, never code that Studio runs.
_Avoid_: plugin, runtime module, code extension

**Extension Source**:
Local folder or GitHub repository release feed where Studio finds Cozy Extensions. Many sources can be active at once.
_Avoid_: marketplace, registry server, pack path

**Workflow Module**:
Optional built-in workflow, such as Character Lab or Sprite Atlas, that the user can turn off in Settings, Extensions. Create and Styles are not modules. A turned-off module hides its workflows, loads none of its code, closes its API routes and rejects its new jobs; its jobs and images stay in the Studio Library.
_Avoid_: plugin, extension, feature flag

**Codex Turn**:
One `codex app-server` turn executed by the backend for a local image task.
_Avoid_: generation step, rpc call

**Local Codex Session**:
Capability snapshot for the local Codex app-server route. ChatGPT HTTP has a separate sign-in and availability state; a connected session does not guarantee available quota.
_Avoid_: account status, API key session, remote auth

**App-Server Lifecycle**:
Backend supervision of `codex app-server`, including ensure reasons and the latest diagnostics.
_Avoid_: just process supervisor, websocket status

**Provider Boundary**:
Backend seam that gives each Generation Provider its own execution path while sharing local job, asset, metadata, log, and catalog contracts.
_Avoid_: multi-provider orchestrator, vendor switch, direct provider call

### Frontend seams

**Legacy Workspace Snapshot**:
Export-only JSON view derived from current Catalog Entries for users who need the former workspace snapshot shape.
_Avoid_: browser cache, import format, recovery source, durable catalog record

**Local Studio Sync**:
Frontend seam that mirrors backend Job Summaries, logs, and live events while requesting scoped Image Catalog reconciliation.
_Avoid_: polling loop, ad-hoc refresh code

**Studio Event Revision**:
Monotonic position assigned to Studio state changes so reconnecting clients can detect missed events and reconcile a scoped snapshot.
_Avoid_: timestamp ordering, EventSource connection count, full record event

**Shell Activity Job**:
Compact shell-facing activity model derived from Job Summaries and live job events.
_Avoid_: full job payload in hot UI reads, queue-only job model, debug-only job row

**Catalog Operation Result**:
Frontend-visible result from an Image Catalog command, including counts, skipped items, warnings, and refresh scope.
_Avoid_: ignored mutation response, toast-only side effect, blind catalog refresh

**Catalog Render Budget**:
Frontend budget that caps how many Catalog Entries each hot catalog surface initially reads or renders.
_Avoid_: magic page size, gallery default limit, arbitrary load cap

**Catalog Card Action Surface**:
Frontend surface that decides when secondary Image Catalog card commands mount.
It keeps touch access and desktop hover or focus polish. It does not mount every command on every idle card.
_Avoid_: hidden per-card toolbar, always-mounted action row, tooltip farm

**Image Grid Geometry Budget**:
Frontend image-grid budget that reserves Catalog card geometry and gives initial-viewport thumbnails eager/high priority without eager-loading the full Catalog Page.
_Avoid_: blanket eager images, lazy LCP thumbnail, index-only image priority

**Route Preload Budget**:
Frontend routing budget that separates active navigation, idle route-shell preload, and explicit recipe hover/focus intent.
_Avoid_: preload every recipe, route import fan-out, hidden startup work

**Local Generation Run**:
Frontend seam that creates Persistent Jobs, waits for completion, and returns catalog-derived image results.
_Avoid_: inline job choreography, direct editor pipeline

**Studio Runtime**:
Frontend runtime adapter that resolves how the renderer reaches the local backend in web or desktop contexts.
_Avoid_: readiness state, onboarding snapshot

**Studio Shell**:
Frontend seam that materializes navigation, overlays, Studio Runtime state, and Catalog Entry presentation into one renderable layout for the app shell.
_Avoid_: AppContent glue, root orchestrator

**Studio Readiness**:
Non-secret snapshot of local runtime and setup facts.
Its Codex diagnostics combine App-Server Lifecycle and Local Codex Session facts. Generation also checks the selected provider's availability; ChatGPT HTTP does not require the Codex runtime to be ready.
_Avoid_: simple health boolean, account check, deep diagnostic command

**Command Center**:
Top toolbar surface for global studio status, provider/runtime usage, queue awareness, library/workspace switching, and entry points to configuration or diagnostics.
_Avoid_: floating status panel, scattered global controls, dashboard-only command surface

**Demand-Mounted Surface**:
UI surface that mounts, fetches, animates, or renders expensive details only while visible or explicitly active.
_Avoid_: always-on panel, hidden live widget, background diagnostics view

**Settings Surface**:
Demand-mounted configuration surface that owns heavy Studio Settings, provider diagnostics, output-source, and maintenance hydration while the Command Center keeps compact status.
_Avoid_: shell-owned settings hydration, always-on settings fetch, toolbar settings detail

**Import Operation**:
Bounded import workflow for larger External Output Source imports, with progress, skipped-file reasons, path-safety checks, and final summary.
_Avoid_: browser-side directory copy, unscoped file scan, silent bulk import

**Storage Repair Plan**:
Read-only maintenance plan for storage repair work such as reference migration, orphan Catalog Entry cleanup, and thumbnail repair.
_Avoid_: direct repair command, secret-printing audit, destructive storage scan

## Relationships

- A **Library Registry** tracks one or more **Studio Libraries** and exactly one default library at a time.
- A registered **Output Directory** stores new final images and exports without becoming a separate SQLite catalog. Each job captures its output root and layout; existing files stay under their original registered roots.
- Shared workflow categories drive discovery and preferences. Character views retain per-mode drafts within one workspace character. Native output background belongs to the Generation Task Spec, not a provider-specific task name.
- **Bootstrap Configuration** locates the initial **Studio Library**, then **Studio Settings** become the editable source of truth.
- **Provider Secrets** live outside **Studio Settings**. Settings can show only availability or validation state.
- One **Studio Library** contains many **Local Assets** and contributes many **Catalog Entries** to the **Image Catalog**.
- An **External Output Source** can be discovered or registered, then imported into a **Studio Library** before destructive or catalog operations.
- A **Catalog Page** contains many **Catalog Entries**.
- **Catalog Entry Detail** completes one compact Catalog Entry only when a caller explicitly needs full generation or diagnostic metadata.
- A **Persistent Job** on the Codex app-server route executes one or more **Codex Turns**. ChatGPT HTTP jobs do not create Codex turns or threads.
- A **Persistent Job** has one **Generation Task** and one **Generation Provider** selected through the **Provider Boundary**.
- **Persistent Job Intake** creates Persistent Jobs and checks the **Provider Capability Catalog** plus runtime preflight to keep Generation Task and Generation Provider policy explicit.
- A **Recipe Module** produces a **Generation Task Spec** for a **Generation Task**.
- A **Recipe Module Catalog** exposes Recipe Module metadata for navigation, scripts, and agents. The **Recipe Discovery Projection** is the query view over modules and aliases.
- An **Animation Frame Handoff** is dispatched and reconciled by the **Animation Sequence Run Coordinator**. The UI consumes an **Animation Sequence Run View**.
- **Recipe Provider Directives** can attach to a **Generation Task Spec** when structured recipe data is strong enough to compile a compact prompt safely.
- A **Generation Provider** compiles a **Generation Task Spec** into provider-specific execution.
- A **Compiled Provider Input** is derived from a **Generation Task Spec**. It can be much smaller than the stored spec.
- A **Provider Session Contract** supplies stable rules that do not need to be repeated in every **Compiled Provider Input**.
- The **Codex Product Runtime** powers interactive Codex jobs. The **Codex Automation Surface** supports non-interactive maintenance workflows.
- A **Style Search Projection** is derived from **Style Preset Manifests** and **Style Pack Manifests**.
- A **Style Pack Manifest** groups many **Style Preset Manifests** without owning all preset content inline.
- An **Extension Source** offers many **Cozy Extensions**. A style-pack extension carries one **Style Pack Manifest** and its **Style Preset Manifests**.
- A **Local Generation Run** creates one or more **Persistent Jobs** and returns their catalog-derived image results.
- **Local Studio Sync** mirrors **Persistent Jobs** and requests scoped **Image Catalog** reconciliation.
- **Local Studio Sync** uses **Studio Event Revisions** to detect missed changes and request scoped reconciliation.
- A **Shell Activity Job** is the shell-facing model for hot job reads. Full **Persistent Job** detail is loaded on demand.
- A **Catalog Operation Result** lets the shell show scoped command outcomes without treating every mutation as a blind full refresh.
- A **Catalog Render Budget** keeps hot **Catalog Page** reads bounded per surface.
- A **Catalog Card Action Surface** keeps secondary card commands available by intent instead of permanently mounted for every **Catalog Entry** card.
- An **Image Grid Geometry Budget** keeps first-viewport Catalog thumbnails discoverable while off-viewport images remain lazy.
- A **Route Preload Budget** lets the **Studio Shell** warm route surfaces by route and user intent without importing every **Recipe Module** surface on Home.
- **Studio Shell** materializes **Studio Runtime**, navigation state, overlays, and **Catalog Entries** into the renderable app layout.
- **Studio Readiness** exposes **Studio Runtime**, **Studio Library**, and Codex runtime diagnostics. Generation readiness is checked for the selected **Generation Provider**.
- The **Command Center** exposes global status and commands, while deeper configuration and diagnostics open from it.
- A **Demand-Mounted Surface** is opened from the **Command Center** or another explicit user action. The **Settings Surface** is the settings-specific demand-mounted surface.
- The **Provider Boundary** keeps ChatGPT HTTP and Codex app-server distinct. New jobs capture their selected route; a failed job never switches providers automatically.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "When a generation finishes, do we render the **Catalog Entry** directly?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes. The backend persists the **Catalog Entry**. **Local Studio Sync** refreshes the affected catalog scope. Then the grid materializes that entry directly."
>
> **Dev:** "So what actually blocks the user from generating?"
> **Domain expert:** "Backend and **Studio Library** readiness matter, then the selected **Generation Provider** must be available. Codex runtime diagnostics do not block an authenticated ChatGPT HTTP job."

## Flagged ambiguities

- `CONTEXT.md` is glossary-only. System shape belongs in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Work rules belong in `AGENTS.md` and the relevant contributor guide.
- `AGENTS.md` guides repo work practices without duplicating the glossary in `CONTEXT.md`.
- **Legacy Workspace Snapshot** is export-only compatibility. It is not read, recovered, or stored as browser state.
- **Studio Settings** are not `.env.local`. Environment files are for **Bootstrap Configuration** and secrets that must exist before the app can load the library.
- **Provider Secret** values must not be stored in the Image Catalog, job metadata, or SQLite-backed Studio Settings.
- **External Output Source** is not a second source of truth. Catalog operations belong to imported **Local Assets** in a **Studio Library**.
- **Studio Runtime** names the backend-resolution adapter. Readiness and onboarding status belong to **Studio Readiness**.
- **Command Center** does not mean putting every control in the toolbar. Global controls live there or open from there instead of floating separately.
- **Demand-Mounted Surface** is the default for heavy diagnostics, file views, activity panels, and visual effects that are not always visible.
- **Local Codex Session** is the app-server capability snapshot for the local ChatGPT login. Studio shows the ChatGPT HTTP sign-in state separately. The phrase "account status" applies only to the compatibility endpoint `/api/codex/account`.
- **Provider Boundary** does not mean the product becomes a generic provider router. ChatGPT HTTP and Codex app-server keep separate captured execution paths behind backend adapters.
- **Generation Task** and **Generation Provider** are separate concepts. Task names do not encode provider names.
- **Provider Capability Catalog** is a fixed build-time capability description, not runtime plugin machinery or a Provider Secret store.
- **Persistent Job Intake** can accept compatibility aliases. New durable policy must preserve the **Generation Task** / **Generation Provider** split.
- **Recipe Module** means a declarative workflow module, not a React-only page or a prebuilt prompt string.
- **Recipe Discovery Projection** aliases help discovery. Aliases are not new **Recipe Modules**.
- **Style Preset Manifest** preserves preset identity and editing locality. One edit must not risk a whole category in a giant pack file.
- **Style Search Projection** derives from manifests, not from visual runtime pack shortcuts.
- **Compiled Provider Input** is execution data, not the durable source of truth. The richer **Generation Task Spec** remains for traceability.
- **Provider Session Contract** contains stable rules only. Task-specific requirements belong in the **Generation Task Spec** and its **Compiled Provider Input**.
- **Codex Automation Surface** does not replace the **Codex Product Runtime** unless a future ADR changes the product architecture.
